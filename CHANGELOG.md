* An option to just talk to trainers. (useful for trainersanity)
* Added option groups to the WebWorld and the template YAML ([@snowflav-goob](https://github.com/snowflav-goob))
* The slot name is now stored in the ROM, so it does not need to be entered when BizHawk Client connects.
* There is now an option to have "relaxed" player and rival name conversion, which replaces unknown characters and truncates
appropriately.
* An event for defeating Team Galactic at Stark Mountain.
* The boat can now be taken between Canalave City, Pastoria City, and Snowpoint City.
* More options for roadblocks in Routes 207, 210, and 215.

* An option to prevent the PopTracker from spoiling optional roadblocks, and client support for the option.
* Generation-time validation that rejects impossible Route 210 lower and Route 215 barricade combinations: when HMs are not randomized and both barricades require a late HM (Surf, Waterfall, Rock Climb or Strength) or are impassable, Celestic Town — and therefore the vanilla HM03 Surf — is unreachable.
### Changed
