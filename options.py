              Swarms can be manually triggered within the route the player is in if the player has the poffin case.

                               of the six Great Marsh regions.
                               At the start, there are eight possible species which can be found. Once the national
                               dex is acquired, another eight species can be encountered.
    - regular_honey_tree: encounters from honey trees. Interact once to slather honey on the tree. Interact a second
                          time for the encounter.
    - munchlax_honey_tree: honey-tree encounters on the munchlax honey trees.
                           At generation, four honey trees are chosen as munchlax honey trees.
                           These will have an additional encounterable species.
                           The munchlax honey trees can be distinguished with the dowsing machine,
                           once the tree camera item is obtained.
                           Before the tree camera is obtained, the probability of the special encounter is 1/100.
                           After it is obtained, the probability is increased to 1/13.
                           The tree camera, Pokétch, and dowsing machine are required by the world's logic to access
                           this encounter.
    - feebas_fishing: in the basement of Mt. Coronet is a large lake. On this lake, four random tiles are selected.
                      These four tiles will have a 1/2 chance of a special encounter.
                      They can be identified using the dowsing machine, once the PokéSonar item is obtained.
                      The PokéSonar, Pokétch, and dowsing machine are required by the world's logic to access
                      this encounter.
    - trophy_garden: in the trophy garden in the mansion in route 210 north, there are special encounters.
                     These are triggered by talking to the rich man in the office, where he will announce that a
                     species can be encountered in the garden. He can be talked to over and over again to cycle
                     the selected species. He can only be triggered once the national dex is obtained.
    - odd_keystone: in route 209, there is a small stone mound. Once an odd keystone is obtained,
                    it can be interacted with to access a special encounter. Each attempt uses an odd keystone.
                    Odd keystones can be purchased in the evolution items shop after one has been obtained.
    - roamers: there are five roaming species. They have different conditions for activation.
               Three are activated by talking to Prof. Oak in Eterna city, after previously obtaining the national dex
               and talking to him in Pal Park Lobby.
               One is activated by interacting with Cresselia on Fullmoon Island.
               One is activated by interacting with Mesprit in the cave on the island at Lake Verity.
               Once they roaming species are activated, their positions can be tracked using the marking map Pokétch
               app, which is required by the world's logic to catch them. The will be randomly encountered in the
